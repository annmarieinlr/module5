# Overview
This is an Android App that will allow young students to practice their parts of speech.
It uses the old "Memory Game" method. Instead of matching two pictures, they will match a part of 
speech with an example for that part of speech. 
For Example: Noun - mouse; Verb - danced.

# Development Environment

I used Android Studio, coding in the Kotlin language to build the app.
I created the graphics using Canva, a free graphic design website.
